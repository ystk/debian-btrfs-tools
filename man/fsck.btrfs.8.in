.SH NAME
fsck.btrfs \- do nothing, successfully
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsck.btrfs
[\fB-aApy\fP]
[\fBdevice...\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fsck.btrfs
is a type of utility that should exist for any filesystem and is
called during system setup when the corresponding
.BR /etc/fstab
entries contain non-zero value for
.BR fs_passno
, see
.BR fstab(5)
for more.
.PP
Traditional filesystems need to run their respective fsck utility in case the
filesystem was not unmounted cleanly and the log needs to be replayed before
mount. This is not needed for BTRFS. You should set fs_passno to 0.
.PP
If you wish to check the consistency of a BTRFS filesystem or repair a damaged
filesystem, see
.BR btrfs(8)
subcommand 'check'. By default the filesystem
consistency is checked, the repair mode is enabled via --repair option (use
with care!).
.SH OPTIONS

with success, otherwise prints a message about \fBbtrfs check\fP.
